# Guess the Number

This is a simple web-based project that features a "Guess the Number" game with three different difficulty levels: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**. Each level leads to a different challenge based on the range of numbers to guess. The game menu is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's designed to be interactive with a responsive layout.

## Features

- **Three Difficulty Levels**:
  - **Easy**: A simple number guessing game with a lower range.
  - **Medium**: A moderately challenging number guessing game.
  - **Hard**: A more complex challenge with a higher number range.

- **Responsive Design**: The menu and buttons adjust based on the screen size, ensuring compatibility with both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Interactive Buttons**: The difficulty buttons have hover and active states that provide an interactive feel.

- **Game Mechanics**:
  - Guess the randomly generated number within a set number of attempts.
  - The user is provided with hints to help them guess (e.g., "TOO low" or "TOO high").
  - Upon guessing correctly, a congratulatory message is shown.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several folders for each difficulty level (`Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`) and includes the following structure:


### Files Overview:
- **index.html (Main Menu)**: This is the main home page that links to the three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, and Hard).
- **Easy/index.html, Medium/index.html, Hard/index.html**: Separate HTML files for each difficulty level, where the game logic resides.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file that contains the logic for the game.
- **styles.css**: CSS file for styling the pages, including the main menu and game difficulty buttons.
